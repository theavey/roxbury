# A Python class to control LG speakers

This package defines the class `Roxbury` that can be used to control LG speakers that work with the LG Music Flow app(s).

It has only been tested with an LG SH7B soundbar, but if someone wants to test on others (or buy me more speakers), please feel free to contribute.

This package is still in early development, and it has only implemented input selection and volume changing so far.

This is largely inspired by [temescal](https://github.com/google/python-temescal), but the API and encryption are a bit different, 
and the implementations are not the same.

I welcome issues and pull requests!
